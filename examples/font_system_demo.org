** JetBrains Mono: Code Font
#set text(font: "JetBrains Mono")

Perfect monospace font for code blocks and technical content:

    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

* Project Custom Fonts Library

** Manrope: Geometric Sans-Serif
#set text(font: "Manrope")

Clean, geometric sans-serif perfect for modern interfaces and technical documentation. Variable weight support from 200-900. Originally a bundled font, now part of the custom library.

*Bold Manrope* and /Italic Manrope/ provide excellent UI typography.

Playfair Display brings elegance and sophistication to headlines and display text. With its high contrast and distinctive character, it's perfect for luxury brands, editorial design, and artistic projects.

*Bold Playfair* and /Italic Playfair/ create dramatic emphasis.

** Fauna One: Classic Serif
#set text(font: "Fauna One")

Fauna One offers a more traditional serif approach, with excellent readability and classic proportions suitable for body text in traditional documents.

** Poppins: Friendly Sans-Serif
#set text(font: "Poppins")

Poppins is a geometric sans-serif with friendly, approachable character. Popular for marketing materials, websites, and user interfaces where warmth and accessibility are important.

*Bold Poppins* creates strong visual hierarchy while maintaining readability.

** Noto Serif: Global Serif
#set text(font: "Noto Serif")

Noto Serif provides excellent international typography support with comprehensive character coverage. Designed for global applications with consistent appearance across languages.

*Bold Noto Serif* and /Italic Noto Serif/ offer professional document typography.

** Lora: Calligraphic Serif
#set text(font: "Lora")

Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay, making it perfect for editorial content.

EB Garamond is a revival of Claude Garamont's famous humanist typeface from the 16th century. Perfect for academic work, classical texts, and sophisticated publications.

*Bold EB Garamond* and /Italic EB Garamond/ evoke classical elegance.

** Roboto: Neutral Sans-Serif
#set text(font: "Roboto")

Roboto has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. It allows letters to be settled into their natural width, creating a more natural reading rhythm.

*Bold Roboto* provides clear hierarchy without strong personality.

* Font Resolution System

#set text(font: "Inter")

The font system works in this order:

1. *Project fonts* (`assets/fonts/`) - Rich custom library (8 families)
2. *Bundled fonts* (in package) - Minimal reliable defaults (3 families)
3. *System fonts* - Final fallback

This architecture provides:
- *Minimal package size* - Only essential fonts bundled (Inter, Crimson Pro, JetBrains Mono)
- *Rich project library* - 8+ font families for creative flexibility
- *Reliable fallbacks* - System fonts ensure text always renders

* Typography Combinations

#set text(font: "Crimson Pro")

Body text in Crimson Pro provides excellent readability for academic and professional content.

#set text(font: "Inter", weight: 600, size: 14pt)

## Inter for Clean Modern Headlines

#set text(font: "Playfair Display", weight: 600, size: 16pt)

Playfair Display for Elegant Titles

### Poppins for Friendly Subheadings

// Code examples in JetBrains Mono
const fonts = ["Inter", "Crimson Pro", "JetBrains Mono"];
const customFonts = ["Manrope", "Playfair Display", "Poppins", "Lora"];

#set text(font: "EB Garamond", size: 11pt)

Classical content can use EB Garamond for sophisticated typography, while technical documentation benefits from the Inter + Crimson Pro + JetBrains Mono combination.

#set text(font: "Lora", style: "italic")

Editorial content flows beautifully in Lora, providing personality without sacrificing readability.

* Package Size Comparison

#set text(font: "Inter", size: 10pt)

- *Previous bundle*: Manrope + Crimson Pro + JetBrains Mono ≈ 700KB
- *New minimal bundle*: Inter + Crimson Pro + JetBrains Mono ≈ 650KB  
- *Custom library*: 8 font families ≈ 2MB (project-specific, not bundled)

The reorganization creates a leaner package while providing richer project-level typography options.
